# FPGA-Based-Biometric-Attendance-System-Using-Fingerprint-Recognition
This project uses FPGA and Verilog to create a fingerprint-based attendance system. Users scan their fingerprint, and the system matches it against stored data, logging attendance securely. It ensures fast, accurate authentication with biometric validation, making attendance tracking efficient and reliable.
